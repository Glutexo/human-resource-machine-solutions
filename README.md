# Human Resource Machine solutions

My solutions to the Human Resource Machine game tasks. Commented, always with both challenges solved. If there is one solution to both challenges, only one file is present. If every challenge needs different solution, there are two files: with _-size_ and _-speed_ suffix. Sometimes there is a generic solution without prefix that fulfills the criteria of any of the challenges, but still accompanied by a suffixed file with an even more optimized solution.

Comments are somehow language-agnostic. They use only numbers and mathematical symbols. However, cardinal numbers are written with a dot to be distingished from values.
